Ryan Murchison has been working on my different projects for most of his life. At the age of eight he was making videos and films. In high school he was making thirty minute long films with professional actors and crew. After going to a art school in Atlanta, he came back to New Orleans to make a short film called Seeking Death. He then made a mockumentary about the conspiracy that Paul McCartney died. He graduated from Baylor University and during that time won awards at the CFF film festival in Virginia. He continues to make films and submit them to festivals.
