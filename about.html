      Ryan Murchison has been working on my different projects for most of his
      life. At the age of eight he was making videos and films. In high school
      he was making thirty minute long films with professional actors and crew.
      After going to a art school in Atlanta, he came back to New Orleans to
      make a short film called Seeking Death. He then made a mockumentary about
      the conspiracy that Paul McCartney died. He graduated from Baylor
      University and during that time won awards at the CFF film festival in
      Virginia. He continues to make films and submit them to festivals.
